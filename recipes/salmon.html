    <h3>A popular Japanese dish that combines the rich, savory flavor of miso with succulent, fatty salmon.</h3>
    <p>
        The best meals are sometimes the simplest ones, and this is certainly one of them. This salmon recipe features a
        delicious caramelized miso glaze on the outside and stays flaky and moist in the middle. It is one of the most
        beloved dining hall meals here at Amherst, and for good reason. While salmon is usually the most popular and
        most accessible fish to use, the same marinade can be used on different types of fish like black cod or
        butterfish. The cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the filet and your specific oven settings,
        so adjust accordingly. This is a classic dish to add to your weekday meal rotation as most of the preparation
        time involves idle waiting time.
