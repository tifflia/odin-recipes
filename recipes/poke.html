    <h3>An infamous Hawaiian dish featuring cubed pieces of raw tuna tossed in a mouth-watering spicy sauce.</h3>
    <p>
        In Hawaiian, poke directly translates to "to slice" or "cut into pieces". The most traditional variation of this
        dish features cubed pieces of raw fish with sea salt, kukui nuts, and limu. With waves of immigrants from China
        and Japan during the plantation boom, other ingredients were introduced to the recipe including soy sauce and
        sesame oil. My favorite version of this recipe is one that mixes mayo and sriracha together to create a creamy
        and decadent sauce that coats each piece of fish. Different types of fish can be used in this recipe, but I
        usually prefer leaner cuts of tuna or ahi. After marinating for a little bit, this poke pairs perfectly with a
        piping hot bowl of rice or even by itself as a snack.
