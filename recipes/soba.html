    <h3>A traditional Japanese dish with buckwheat noodles, served cold.</h3>
    <p>
        During my second trip to Japan in the summer of 2023, I got to try these noodles in Kyoto at a restaurant that
        was overlooking Katsura River. Perhaps it was the scenery or the shock of being in such a beautiful place that
        made the noodles taste so much better, but I have been obsessed with this dish ever since. When cooked right,
        the bounce of the chewy buckwheat noodles is insanely addicting paired with the light yet deeply umami tsuyu
        sauce. The beauty of this dish is in its simplicity and since all the components of the dish should be chilled,
        it is a classic summertime meal that is great for lazy cooking days.
